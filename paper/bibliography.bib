    abstract = {Seventy-five years of the study of matroids has seen the development of a rich theory with links to graphs, lattices, codes, transversals,0020and projective geometries. Matroids are of fundamental importance in combinatorial optimization and their applications extend into electrical and structural engineering. This book falls into two parts: the first provides a comprehensive introduction to the basics of matroid theory, while the second treats more advanced topics. It contains over 700 exercises, and includes proofs of all of the major theorems in the subject. The last two chapters review current research and list more than eighty unsolved problems along with a description of the progress towards their solutions.},

    abstract="The matroids have a wide range of applications in discrete mathematics, combinatorial mathematics, computer science and other fields. However, most of the researches about matroids focus on the mathematical level, and there is a lack of exploration on functional modelling and formal verification. In this paper, we propose a general functional modeling framework for matroids, which consists of the basic elements of matroids, the verification functions of basic properties, and the verification functions of matroids. Finally, the functional modeling framework of this paper is used to verify whether the 0-1 knapsack problem and the fractional knapsack problem conform to the matroid structure, thus exemplifying the correctness of the matroid functional modeling and the matroid verification function, and reflecting the validity and extensibility of this framework.",
