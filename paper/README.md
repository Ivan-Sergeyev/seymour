## Notes:

* Keep consistent spelling and capitalization: Lean, Lean 4, Mathlib, Aesop (project), aesop (tactic).
  None of the above should be italicized. The last one, when referring to a tactic call, should be \texttt{aesop}, everything else normal text.
  Also, I suggest not mentioning versions with Mathlib (would be mathlib3 and Mathlib4).
