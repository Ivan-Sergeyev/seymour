\subsection{Suggestions for Aesop}

The tactic \texttt{aesop} is very powerful and allowed us to prove quite a few lemmas automatically. Unfortunately, in certain situations \texttt{aesop} does not close the goal even when it most likely should. For example, it never uses \texttt{Ne.symm}, so it could happen that \texttt{aesop} can close the goal only with $x \neq y$ provided in the context, but not with $y \neq x$. Another downside is that \texttt{aesop} does not make use of the \texttt{fin\_cases} tactic. This could be extremely beneficial whenever there is just a handful of cases that need to be considered. For example, the workload of analyzing \texttt{Fin 3} values is similar to analyzing all possible constructors of a term from an inductive type with three constructors, yet the former is not supported.
