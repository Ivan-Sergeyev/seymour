\subsection{Suggestions for Mathlib}

We extensively utilized Mathlib in our project, especially its support for matrices, linear independence, and matroids, and we saw three areas for potential improvement. First, the support for block matrices could be extended. Second, we noticed that the API for constructing single-row and single-column matrices has been getting less convenient over time. During our work on the project, converting a vector \texttt{r} to a single-row matrix containing \texttt{r} evolved from \leaninline{Matrix.row r}, to \leaninline{Matrix.row Unit r}, to \leaninline{Matrix.replicateRow Unit r}. To make this more concise in our implementation, we introduced custom notation for such operations, and we wish the syntax in Mathlib was simplified. Last but not least, we found that the \texttt{variable} command is sometimes exploited in the source code of Mathlib to hide explicit arguments. We would suggest against using this command this way, to make the source code of the library easier to read and use.
