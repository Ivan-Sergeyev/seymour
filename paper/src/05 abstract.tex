Seymour's decomposition theorem is a hallmark result in matroid theory presenting a structural characterization of the class of regular matroids. Formalization of matroid theory faces many challenges, most importantly that only a limited number of fundamental notions and results have been implemented so far. In this work, we formalize the proof of the forward (composition) direction of Seymour's theorem for matroids that have finite rank and potentially infinite ground sets. To this end, we develop a library in Lean 4 that implements definitions and results about totally unimodular matrices, vector matroids, their standard representations, regular matroids, and 1-, 2-, and 3-sums of matrices and vector matroids given by their standard representations. Using this framework, we formally state Seymourâ€™s decomposition theorem for regular matroids and implement a formally verified proof of the forward (composition) direction of this theorem in the setting where the matroids have finite rank and may have infinite ground sets.
